Developer Guide
==================================

The DIRAC Developer Guide is describing the procedures and rules for developing new DIRAC components.

This documentation can be freely modified, as it is maintained in the `DiracGRID/DIRACDocs <https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRACDocs>`_ repository in GitHub. As developer, you are not only welcome to add or modify documentation: you are required to add documentation for everything that deserves a careful explanation. 

For every question, or comment, regarding specific development activities, including suggestion and comments to the `RFC <https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/wiki/DIRAC-Requests-For-Comments-%28RFC%29>`_, the correct forum for is the `dirac-develop <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diracgrid-develop>`_ google group. For everything operational, instead, you can write on the `dirac-grid <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diracgrid-forum>`_ group.
